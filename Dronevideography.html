            <p class="small-text">A Drone can fly the device up to 400 feet, so you don't have to feel
                limited to ground-level shots.
                You can take advantage of the unique and dynamic aerial shots a drone can capture. Certain shots are
                best taken by a drone camera and some by a traditional camera, so have the best of both worlds in
                your wedding album. Drone photographer or videographer can take wide sweeping shots while your
                ground photographer captures close-ups and intimate moments. The aerial view gives you the chance to
                have fun with your wedding guests by creating the shape of a heart or spelling out your and your
                partner's first initials. Drone photography to add beauty to your wedding. We have a well trained
                drone poilet that help to capture drone photography and videography.</p>
